    question: "When is the last day to give Qurbani?",
    answer: "Qurbani must be performed during the days of Eid al-Adha, starting after Eid prayer on the 10th of Dhul Hijjah and ending before sunset on the 13th of Dhul Hijjah. We recommend donating early to ensure proper processing."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is obligated to give Qurbani?",
    answer: "Qurbani is obligatory (Wajib) for every sane Muslim who has reached puberty and possesses wealth equal to or above the nisab threshold (approximately $5,200 USD in savings). This applies to both men and women."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I give Qurbani on behalf of someone else?",
    answer: "Yes, you can give Qurbani on behalf of deceased relatives, family members, or the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Many donors give multiple Qurbanis to include their loved ones."
  },
  {
    question: "How is the meat distributed?",
    answer: "Our local partners distribute the sacrificed meat fresh to families in need within 24-48 hours. We prioritize communities with limited access to protein and nutritious food, including refugee camps and impoverished villages."
  },
  {
    question: "Which countries do you serve?",
    answer: "We distribute Qurbani meat in over 15 countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan, Palestine, Sudan, and other regions where poverty and food insecurity are prevalent."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I receive confirmation of my Qurbani?",
    answer: "Yes! You'll receive an email confirmation immediately after donating. After Eid, we send a detailed report with photos and information about the distribution in your selected region."
